    \ get an API Token. This token needs to be sent as a HTTP header argument in every\
    \ request to our API.\n\napi-token=“SECRET KEY”\n\nPlease keep your api-token\
    \ a secret. If the token is compromised please contact us to get a new one.\n\n\
    This api token authenticates your application and gives it access to the API.\n\
    \nThe API token should not be confused with the end-user-token. That token is\
    \ given to you via the end_user_authentications endpoint when the user logs in.\
    \ This token is needed in order to use certain features, and get certain sensitive\
    \ information.\n\nBoth Tokens are stateless, and delivered via the HTTP headers."
