        Rather than having this as an option in the query parameter or json body
        we could add it to the url like we do with df stuff. it would look
        something like /alerts/jobs/ or /alerts/resumes


        I'm ok with either option. The reason I picked this one is beacause
        favorites already follows this convention. It obviously could be changed
        to match as well.
