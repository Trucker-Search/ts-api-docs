                    Sent means that the contact sent your user a message, but it
                    has not yet been read by them. Messages are automatically
                    marked as read when the GET /messages endpoint is called for
                    that conversation. This will return null when the contact
                    has not yet sent a message back to your user. 
                      user_block means that the user has blocked this contact. You can use   the patch method to remove the block.

                    will be null.

    By default all new contacts are able to send messages to the user. By
    blocking a contact, all future messages from the contact will be marked as
    user_block.
      Also by design, users are unable to "delete" contacts, but this action will be   simulated using this endpoint. In order to hide the conversation move it to the Trash folder.

              Setting this to true will set the status of incomming messages to
              'user_block'. It will also set the conversation status to
              'user_block'. 
               Setting it to false will remove this filter. It will also revert the conversation status. It will not change the status of messages already sent by the contact.
