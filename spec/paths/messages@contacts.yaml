    By default all new contacts are able to send messages to the user. By
    blocking a contact, all future messages from the contact will be marked as
    user_block.
      Also by design, users are unable to "delete" contacts, but this action will be  simulated using this endpoint. In order to hide the conversation move it to the Trash folder.
