    This is the method that pulls down a conversation. Eeach user can only  only
    have one conversation per contact. 
     Hidden messages are returned along with the   normal sent & read messages. This gives you the API developer the option to show  them if requested by the user, as well as updating individual messages. Hidden messages   ignore the mark_as_read flag. 
      Internally we have other statuses like pending, and rejected, but public users   of our API don't have access to them.

    - description: Who the conversation is with.

    This will send a message to any other user. Currently there are no blocks or
    set restrictions if an API user just started guessing. In order to get a
    contact_id a contact user would need to pull that info from a resume, or a
    job ad.
