      Sent means that the contact sent your user a message, but it has not yet
      been read by them. Messages are automatically marked as read when the GET
      /messages endpoint is called for that conversation. This will return null
      when the contact has not yet sent a message back to your user. 
        user_block means that the user has blocked this contact. You can use  the patch method to remove the block.
